# Andriod Cross Platform Mobile Helper 

# Description
Cross Platform Mobile Helper is for mobile developers. Mobile developers learn one mobile platform and become very knowledgeable on one platform. I wrote this app to help me cross platforms to Andriod mobile. Understanding a control on one platform like a label I am able to click on label and the detail pages shows you the control on other platforms, i.e. iOS equals UILabel, Windows 8 equals TextBlock and Android equals TextView.
